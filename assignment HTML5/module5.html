    <ul><li><h3>What are the new tags added in HTML5?</h3></li></ul>
    <h4>
        HTML5 introduced several new tags to enhance the structure and functionality of web pages. Some of the notable new tags include:
        <br>
        <br>
< article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed and reused independently.
<br>
<br>

< aside>: Defines content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar or a pull quote.
<br>
<br>

< nav>: Represents a navigation menu, providing links to other pages or parts of the current page.
<br>
<br>

< header>: Defines a header for a section or page, typically containing headings, logos, and navigation elements.
<br>
<br>

< footer>: Represents a footer for a section or page, typically containing metadata, copyright information, or links to related resources.
<br>
<br>

< section>: Represents a generic section of a document, often grouped with a heading.
<br>
<br>

< figure> and < figcaption>: < figure> is used to encapsulate media content (such as images, videos, and diagrams), while < figcaption> provides a caption or description for the content within < figure>.
<br>
<br>

< main>: Represents the main content of a document and is intended to exclude content that is tangential or supplementary.
<br>
<br>

< mark>: Highlights text within the document.
<br>
<br>

< progress>: Represents the completion progress of a task.
<br>
<br>

< time>: Represents a specific period in time or a range of time, allowing for machine-readable date and time information.
<br>
<br>

< meter>: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as disk usage or a download/upload progress bar.
<br>
<br>

< output>: Represents the result of a calculation or user action.
<br>
<br>

< datalist>: Provides a predefined list of options for other controls, such as < input> elements.
<br>
<br>

< details> and < summary>: < details> is used to create a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information, and < summary> is used to provide a summary or caption for the content within < details>.
<br>
<br>

These tags, along with other features introduced in HTML5, contribute to improved semantics, accessibility, and the overall structure of web documents.

<ul><li><h3>How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h3></li></ul>

<h3>Embedding Audio:</h3>
<audio controls>
    <source src="your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>This code creates an audio player with controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) and specifies the audio file (your-audio-file.mp3). Make sure to replace the placeholder with the actual path to your audio file. You can provide multiple <source> elements to support different file formats.</p>  
<h3>Embedding Video:</h3>
<video controls width="600" height="400">
    <source src="your-video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
<p>Similar to audio, this code creates a video player with controls and specifies the video file (your-video-file.mp4). You can adjust the width and height attributes to set the dimensions of the video player.</p>
<ul><li><h3> Semantic element in HTML5?</h3></li></ul>

<p>
    Semantic elements in HTML5 are tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of a web page. They provide a clearer indication to both browsers and developers about the purpose and role of the enclosed content. Using semantic elements improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and makes the HTML code more readable. Here are some commonly used semantic elements in HTML5:
    <ul><ol>< article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article or blog post.</ol>
        <ol>< section>: Defines a thematic grouping of content within a document. It's often used to group related content together.</ol>
  <ol>< nav>: Represents a navigation menu. It's typically used to contain links to other pages or sections of the same page.</ol>
  <ol>< header>: Represents the header of a section or page. It can include headings, logos, navigation, and other introductory content.</ol>
  <ol>< footer>: Represents the footer of a section or page. It typically contains metadata, copyright information, and links to related pages.</ol>
  <ol>< main>: Represents the main content of the document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars. It helps screen readers and other tools identify the primary content.</ol>
  <ol>< aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar or pull quote.</ol>
</ul>
</p>
<ul><li><h3> Canvas and SVG tags</h3></li></ul>
<p> 
   
Certainly! In HTML5, the < canvas> and < svg> tags are commonly used for creating graphics, but they have different approaches to rendering. Here's an overview: 
<h4>< canvas> Element:</h4>
    The < canvas> element provides a bitmap-based drawing surface that can be manipulated using JavaScript. It's suitable for dynamic, pixel-based graphics, such as games or interactive visualizations.
</p>
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
  ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
</script>
<p>In this example, we create a canvas with a specific width and height, obtain the 2D rendering context, and draw a blue rectangle on it.</p>
<h4>< svg> Element:</h4>
<p>The < svg> element, on the other hand, is a vector graphics format. It uses XML to describe 2D graphics and supports a wide range of drawing elements and attributes. SVG is often used for static graphics and illustrations, and it's scalable without loss of quality.</p>
<svg width="400" height="100">
    <rect width="100" height="100" fill="red" />
  </svg>
  <p>In this example, we use SVG to draw a red rectangle. The attributes of the <rect> element define the position, width, height, and fill color of the rectangle.</p>
    <h4>Choosing Between Canvas and SVG:</h4>
    <ul><li>Canvas: Best suited for dynamic and pixel-based graphics, such as games and interactive charts. It's good for scenarios where you need to update the graphics frequently or work with pixel-level manipulation.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>SVG: Ideal for static graphics, logos, illustrations, and scenarios where scalability is essential. SVG graphics can be easily manipulated and styled with CSS, and they maintain quality when resized.</li></ul>
    <p>Both < canvas> and < svg> have their strengths, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your project. You can even use them together in a web page based on the needs of different parts of your application.</p>
