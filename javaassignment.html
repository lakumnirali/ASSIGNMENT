    <h3>• What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
    <br>
    <h3>• What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
    <p>The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>• What is negative Infinity? </h3>
    <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is the same as the negative value of the global object's Infinity property. This value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including POSITIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY .</p>
    <br>
    <h3>• Which company developed JavaScript?</h3>
    <p> <h4> Netscape</h4>
        The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>• What are undeclared and undefined variables? </h3>
        <p>Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value. Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>• Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? </h3>
        <p>Syntax: document. createElement("<tagName>"); // Where <tagName> can be any HTML // tagName like div, ul, button, etc. // newDiv element has been created For Eg: let newDiv = document. createElement("div");</p>
            <br>
            <h3>• What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </h3>
            <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>• What is === operator? </h3>
            <p>In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically. Common simple examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.</p>
